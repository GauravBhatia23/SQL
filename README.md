# SQL
SQL code for analysing rentals at a fictional film rental company.

This project involves working as a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth, a movie rental company planning to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. As part of the business intelligence department, the analyst's task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system and use SQL to analyze the data to answer ad-hoc business questions. The main questions that the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board wants to answer include identifying the movies that contributed the most/least to revenue gain, the average rental duration for all videos, customer demographics, and sales figures across geographic regions.
